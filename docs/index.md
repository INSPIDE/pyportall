# Welcome to pyportall

pyportall is Portall's Python SDK, the Python gateway to Portall's data and services.

## Warning

Much like Portall itself, pyportall is still in a very early stage of development. So please bear with us. We will do our best to limit backwards-incompatible changes, but we will certainly have to live with them for a while. Thanks for understanding.

You can also expect this documentation to improve a lot in the coming weeks!
